                  <p class="card-text">
                    Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.

The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the “sexiest job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review (link resides outside of IBM). Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and presented in various formats.
                  </p>
                  <h4>The Data Science Lifecycle</h4>
                  <p>Now that you know what is data science, next up let us focus on the data science lifecycle. Data science’s lifecycle consists of five distinct stages, each with its own tasks: </p>
                  
                  <p>
                   
<p>1.Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction. This stage involves gathering raw structured and unstructured data.
</p><p>2.Maintain: Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture. This stage covers taking the raw data and putting it in a form that can be used.</p>
<p>
3.Process: Data Mining, Clustering/Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization. Data scientists take the prepared data and examine its patterns, ranges, and biases to determine how useful it will be in predictive analysis.</p>
<p>4.Analyze: Exploratory/Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis. Here is the real meat of the lifecycle. This stage involves performing the various analyses on the data.</p>
<p>5.Communicate: Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making. In this final step, analysts prepare the analyses in easily readable forms such as charts, graphs, and reports.</p>
                  </p>
                  <h4>Career opportunities</h4>
                  <p>
                    Data science careers provide high salaries and competitive job opportunities in a variety of industries. Between 2019 and 2029, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects strong growth rates for many data science careers, including market research analysts (18%), computer and information research scientists (15%), computer systems analysts (7%), and operations research analysts (25%).<p>

Careers in data science often offer salaries that are much higher than the national average. As the table below indicates, data scientists can earn well over $100,000 per year, depending on their experience. According to the BLS, data scientists and professionals in mathematical science occupations earn a mean annual salary of $100,560. Exact salaries vary depending on a worker's employer, industry, location, education, and experience.</p>

                        <h4>What Does a Software Engineer Do?</h4>
                        <p>A software engineer creates, maintains, and manages software applications. If you want to become a software engineer, you need to learn coding, Agile development, and other technical skills. Below are some duties of software engineers.</p>
                       <p>Updates programs: Software engineers make an active program runs smoothly through updates and bug fixes. Some software engineers become quality assurance testers as well.</p>
                       <p>Creates new programs: Software engineers design and create new programs for users and companies. This can be anything from mobile apps to video game software.</p>
                       <p>Analyzes code: Software engineers may look at an organization’s needs and create software to meet them. Sometimes, software engineers have to work with code they didn’t write, which means learning analysis is important to becoming a software engineer.</p>
                       <p>Keeps track of software development: Creating software often involves the work of multiple teams. Software engineers keep track of internal code and ensure the application meets user needs.</p>
                       <p>The full scope of software engineering duties depends on the organization and the size of the development team. Software engineer responsibilities could be as broad as designing, developing, and maintaining an entire product. </p>

                        <p>By contrast, those responsibilities could also be as small as helping structure the code of an app on larger teams. Software engineers usually have to work with other developers, clients, and stakeholders to fulfill the design needs for their products.</p>
                        
                       <p> Some software engineering roles include artificial intelligence, whereas others may work on managing server-side programs. Whatever the role, a software engineer will use programming languages to write and maintain code.</p>

An engineer must also clearly state design aspects and instructions to ensure the manufacturing process goes smoothly.</p>
                       <p>Analytical Skills: An engineer must test their design multiple times to achieve a desired result. These professionals need to locate local issues in a larger system by testing, recording data, and analyzing the results.</p>
                       <p>Problem-solving Skills: After analyzing flaws in the system, engineers need to find alternative ways of achieving the initial design goal or task. These employees may need to balance performance with the price or availability of resources while developing a project.</p>

                        <p>Critical Thinking: When testing and altering a product design, engineers need to account for other factors affected by each change. Creating a successful design may require engineers to develop new techniques or look for solutions outside their standard field.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.

The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the “sexiest job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review (link resides outside of IBM). Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.

                  <p>
                    Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The data used for analysis can come from many different sources and presented in various formats.

                  <h4>The Data Science Lifecycle</h4>
                  <p>Now that you know what is data science, next up let us focus on the data science lifecycle. Data science’s lifecycle consists of five distinct stages, each with its own tasks: </p>
                  
                  <p>
                   
<p>1.Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction. This stage involves gathering raw structured and unstructured data.
</p><p>2.Maintain: Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture. This stage covers taking the raw data and putting it in a form that can be used.</p>
<p>
3.Process: Data Mining, Clustering/Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization. Data scientists take the prepared data and examine its patterns, ranges, and biases to determine how useful it will be in predictive analysis.</p>
<p>4.Analyze: Exploratory/Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis. Here is the real meat of the lifecycle. This stage involves performing the various analyses on the data.</p>
<p>5.Communicate: Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making. In this final step, analysts prepare the analyses in easily readable forms such as charts, graphs, and reports.</p>
                  </p>
                  <h4>Career opportunities</h4>
                  <p>
                    Data science careers provide high salaries and competitive job opportunities in a variety of industries. Between 2019 and 2029, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects strong growth rates for many data science careers, including market research analysts (18%), computer and information research scientists (15%), computer systems analysts (7%), and operations research analysts (25%).<p>

Careers in data science often offer salaries that are much higher than the national average. As the table below indicates, data scientists can earn well over $100,000 per year, depending on their experience. According to the BLS, data scientists and professionals in mathematical science occupations earn a mean annual salary of $100,560. Exact salaries vary depending on a worker's employer, industry, location, education, and experience.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Journalism is the practice of gathering, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting news and information to audiences through various media channels such as newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and online platforms. It involves reporting on current events, issues, trends, and developments that are of public interest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The primary goal of journalism is to provide the public with accurate, timely, and relevant information so that individuals can make informed decisions about their lives, communities, and societies. Journalists often adhere to principles of objectivity, impartiality, accuracy, and fairness in their reporting.

                    Journalism encompasses various forms, including investigative journalism, feature writing, opinion pieces, photojournalism, broadcast journalism, and multimedia storytelling. Journalists often play a crucial role in holding governments, institutions, and individuals accountable, as well as in shaping public discourse and awareness.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to traditional forms of journalism, the rise of digital technology has transformed the landscape of journalism, enabling new forms of storytelling, distribution, and audience engagement through online platforms, social media, and mobile devices.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    BAMS stands for Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery. It is an undergraduate degree program in the field of Ayurveda, which is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India thousands of years ago. BAMS is a comprehensive course that covers various aspects of Ayurvedic principles, practices, diagnosis, and treatment methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The curriculum of BAMS typically includes subjects such as anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, pathology, toxicology, herbal medicine, yoga, and surgery, among others. Students also learn about Ayurvedic principles like doshas (biological energies), dhatus (tissues), and the importance of maintaining balance for overall health and well-being.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Upon completion of the BAMS program, graduates can practice as Ayurvedic doctors, prescribing herbal medicines, dietary and lifestyle advice, and other Ayurvedic treatments to manage various health conditions. BAMS graduates may also choose to pursue higher education or research in Ayurveda.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's worth noting that the practice of Ayurveda varies by region and country, and regulations governing its practice may differ accordingly. Therefore, individuals interested in pursuing BAMS or practicing Ayurveda should familiarize themselves with the regulations and requirements in their specific location.

                  </p>
                  <strong>curriculam</strong>
                  <p>

                  <strong>Clinical Training:</strong>
                  <p>Clinical training is a vital component of BSc Nursing programs.

Under the supervision of experienced nursing faculty and preceptors, students apply theoretical knowledge to real-life patient care situations, develop clinical judgment, and enhance their nursing skills.</p>
                  <strong>Licensure and Certification: </strong>
                  <p>
                    Upon completion of a BSc Nursing program, graduates are eligible to take the national licensure examination to become a registered nurse (RN) in their respective country or region. In the United States, this is typically the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). Passing the licensure exam is a prerequisite for practicing as a registered nurse.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Career Opportunities</strong>

BSc Nursing graduates may also pursue advanced practice roles, leadership positions, or further education in nursing through graduate-level programs.</p> 
                  <strong>Further Education: </strong>
                  <p>
                    BSc. Nursing serves as a foundation for further education and specialization in nursing. Many graduates pursue advanced degrees such as Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), or Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing (Ph.D.).
                  </p>
                  <strong>Professional Development: </strong>

                  <h4 class="card-title">WHAT IS FINE ARTS?</h4>
                  <p class="card-text">
                   Fine arts encompass a broad range of artistic disciplines that are primarily concerned with aesthetic expression and beauty. These can include visual arts, such as painting, sculpture, drawing, and printmaking, as well as performing arts, such as music, dance, theater, and film. Fine arts often involve the creation of works that are meant to be appreciated for their intellectual, emotional, or sensory impact, rather than for their practical or utilitarian value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Throughout history, fine arts have played a crucial role in reflecting and shaping cultural, social, and political contexts. Artists have used their work to explore and challenge conventions, express personal and collective experiences, and provoke thought and emotion in viewers and audiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fine arts education typically involves training in various techniques, theories, and concepts relevant to specific artistic disciplines. This education can take place in formal settings such as art schools, academies, and universities, or through informal apprenticeships and self-directed study.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Contemporary fine art often intersects with other disciplines, such as technology, science, and philosophy, leading to innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to artistic expression. Fine artists continue to push boundaries, experiment with new materials and techniques, and engage with pressing issues and ideas of their time.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Fashion design involves the creation of clothing and accessories, ranging from everyday wear to haute couture. Fashion designers conceptualize and create designs that reflect cultural trends, personal expression, and functionality

                  <p>
                    Some work closely with the media to promote products. Others
                    conduct research in an area of personal interest in this
                    field. Most home economists supervise at least one other
                    employee.

                  <p>More specialized aspects include:</p>

                    Counselling: home economics counselling is given informally
                    and is aimed at developing every family member within the
                    family’s income and their physical, mental and intellectual
                    abilities. Individuals, organizations and associations are
                    provided with information by means of projects and
                    demonstrations, posters, audio-visual aids, pictures,
                    pamphlets, placards, cookbooks, etc.

                    Journalism: the press, radio and television offer
                    interesting opportunities for a person who is original and
                    creative. The home economist may become a journalist on a
                    full-time, part-time or freelance basis. Many home
                    economists write books or columns for newspapers and
                    magazines.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Home economists work in a very large variety of work
                    settings. The actual setting is determined by the type,
                    size, location and financial resources of the employer, and
                    by the speciality, experience and education of the home
                    economist. Some positions require evening work and extensive
                    travel.

                  <h4 class="card-title">WHAT IS BHMS?</h4>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    BHMS stands for Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery. It is an undergraduate degree program in the field of homeopathy, which is a system of alternative medicine based on the principle of treating "like with like." In homeopathy, highly diluted substances are used to stimulate the body's natural healing processes.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Here are some key points about BHMS:</strong>
                  <strong>Duration:</strong>
                  <p>
                    BHMS is typically a 5.5-year undergraduate degree program, including a one-year internship period, in some countries like India. 
                  </p>
                  <strong>Curriculum: </strong>
                  <p>The BHMS curriculum includes the study of homeopathic principles, anatomy, physiology, pathology, materia medica (study of homeopathic remedies), pharmacology, and clinical training</p>
                  <strong>Clinical Training:</strong>
                  <p> BHMS students undergo clinical training where they observe and sometimes participate in patient care under the supervision of experienced homeopathic practitioners</p>
                  <strong>Licensing and Regulation:</strong>
                  <p>
                    n many countries, including India, graduates of BHMS programs must pass licensing exams to practice homeopathy legally.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Scope of Practice:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Homeopaths who hold a BHMS degree can work in private practice, homeopathic hospitals, clinics, and research institutions. They may also work alongside conventional medical practitioners or as part of integrated healthcare teams.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Criticism and Controversy:</strong>
                  <p>Homeopathy as a field often faces criticism from the scientific and medical communities due to the lack of scientific evidence supporting its principles and effectiveness beyond a placebo effect. However, it remains popular among certain segments of the population who seek alternative and holistic approaches to healthcare.</p>
                  <strong>Further Education:</strong>
                  <p>Some BHMS graduates pursue further education and specialization in homeopathy or other fields of medicine.</p>
                  <p>Overall, BHMS programs provide students with a comprehensive understanding of homeopathic principles and practices, preparing them for careers as homeopathic practitioners.</p>

              <h4 class="card-title">WHAT IS IT ABOUT ENGINEERING?</h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                Engineering is the application of science and maths to solve
                problems. Engineers figure out how things work and use for
                scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get
                credit for innovations that advance human condition, but it
                is the engineers who are instrumental in making these
                innovatons available to the global population. Engineering
                is one of the corner stones of STEM(science, technology,
                engineering, mathematics) education, an interdisciplinary
                curriculum designed to motivate students to learn about the
                evolving world. A career in engineering requires continual
                professional development to remain relevant and effective in
                today's rapidly changing global society. There are currently
                more than 15 million engineers across various disciplines
                worldwide and with the surge in technological advancements
                and preparedness, anyone can be a part of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Engineering spreads over multiple fields such as
                bio-engineering to the more common mechanical engineering
                courses. Engineering is a hands-on course that relies more
                on practicality and not theory based studies. However,
                engineering optons such as software engineering offer the
                rare pleasure of being a mind based field where traditional
                college institutions as well as highly-acclaimed online
                programmes strive to provide high grade content and
                knowledge. All is not lost though, since engineering favours
                both the active and passive. An engineering degree takes
                upto tho 5 years to acquire whereas the masters and PhDs
                take 2 years each.
